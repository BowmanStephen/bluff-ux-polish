# Bluff UX Polish

## Stack
- Next.js 16 (App Router, `src/` directory)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- npm

## Conventions
- Components split at ~150 lines
- Build UI in blocks (nav → hero → features), not full pages
- Tailwind for all styling — no CSS modules

## Scripts
- `scripts/daily-compound-review.sh` — Nightly script that extracts learnings from Claude Code sessions and appends them below.
